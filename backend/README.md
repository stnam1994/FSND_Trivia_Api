# Full Stack Trivia API Backend

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the
[python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Environment

It is preferred if you run this in a virtual environment for python. If you are using `pipenv`, virtual environment
would be taken care of by `pipenv`. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in
the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:

```bash
pipenv install
```
or if you are not using `pipenv`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

#### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend micro-services framework. Flask is required to handle
requests and responses.
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite
database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py.
- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests
from our frontend server.

## Database Setup (_Important_)
Install and setup "PostgreSQL" on the system and create a database named `trivia` in the Postgres server.
```bash
createdb trivia
```

Instructions (macOS): https://www.codementor.io/engineerapart/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-osx-are8jcopb

With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
cd database
psql trivia < database/trivia.psql
```

## Running the server

Ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.
The application will be served on **http://localhost:5000**

## Testing

To run the flask tests, run the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest discover -t ../
```
_NOTE_: Make sure you create a database named `trivia` in the PostgreSQL server before running the tests.
